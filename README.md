Flow is a minimalist Pomodoro timer designed to help you achieve flow state and deep work.

## ✨ Features

## 📥 Installation

1.  Download the latest `.dmg` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/MuQY1818/Flow/releases) page.
2.  Open `Flow.dmg`.

Since this app is not signed with an Apple Developer ID (I'm an individual developer without the $99/year certificate 🥲), macOS Gatekeeper might block it. 

**To fix this:**
1.  Open `Terminal`.
2.  Run the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Flow.app
    ```
3.  Or simply **Right-click** the app -> Select **Open** -> Click **Open** in the dialog.

## 🚀 Usage

1.  **Start Focus**: Click the "Start Focus" button. The interface will glow to indicate you are in flow mode.
2.  **Switch Mode**: Use the top tab bar to switch between "Controls" (Timer) and "Stats" (History).
3.  **Select Tag**: Click the tag menu above the timer to choose your current activity type.
4.  **Settings**: Click the slider icon in the bottom right to adjust timer durations and sound preferences.
5.  **Right-Click Menu**: Right-click the menu bar icon to:
    - Show/Hide floating ball
